Introduction

The 2016-17 NBA season was yet another fantastic season for the Golden States Warriors, winning their fifth NBA Championship ("2016-17"). In this report, the scoring efficacy of the Hampton Five, which includes Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant, and Andre Iguodala during the 2016-17 NBA season is analyzed. Two-point shots and shots attempted closer to the hoop are more likely to succeed than three-point shots and shots attempted further from the hoop, respectively, and these differing success rates impact the locations of shots attempted and the relative efficacies of the players' shots.

Background
----------

The Golden States Warriors, also known as the "Dubs," is an NBA team based in Oakland, California. During the past decade or so, the Warriors has had exceptional performance within this past decade, claiming several records such as the best ever regular season and most wins in a season. The players have also claimed numerous titles and accolades, with Stephen Curry winning MVP in both the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and Draymond Green winning Defensive Player of the Year in the 2016-17 season, among other accolades ("Golden State Warriors").

One notable change in the Golden States Warriors team roster for the 2016-17 season was the acquisition of Kevin Durant during the off-season, which helped bolster the Warriors' performance. As his performance during the 2016-17 season illustrated, Kevin Durant was one of the team's best players, becoming one of the Golden State Warrior's "Fantastic Four," which also includes Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green ("2016-17").

One well-known feature of the Warriors is their shot efficiency. The Warriors is the fourth team in the last 20 years to make more than half their shots, and have set the all-time record for effective field goal percentage for multiple years in a row (Schuhmann). One contributor to these statistics is that the Warriors are relatively efficient shooters even at mid-range (Shea).

Analyzing the success rates of the shots made by the Warriors, particularly by shot types, could provide insight into the Warriors' shot efficiency. Breaking down and analyzing the shots of the Hampton Five, one of the most effective starting lineups in the Warriors, would provide sufficient insight for this purpose.

Analysis and Discussion
-----------------------

Shot efficacy varies between the type of shot, two-point vs. three-point, and the distance of the shot from the hoop. At least 40% of shots attempted for each overall were made, with the top two most shot-effective players (Durant and Iguodala) making over 50% of their shots. Around at least half of two-point shot attempts were successful, while 30-50% of three-point shots were successful. Thus, two-point shots are significantly more efficient than three-point shots. No shots beyond 305 ft away from the hoop were successful. This shows that shots become less effective when they are attempted further from the hoop.

Shooting efficacy among the players varies between players and shot types. Green is consistently the least effective shooter for two-point, three-point, and overall shots. This may be in part because Green is primarily a defensive player within the Hamptons Five. Aside from Green, these players tend to be better at one shot type than the other, relative to the other four players. For example, Iguodala had made the highest percentage of two-point shots, but the fourth highest percentage of three-point shots.

Almost all players, besides Curry, attempt more two-point shots than three-point shots. Durant, in particular, attempted twice as many two-point shots than three-point shots. This observation shows that the players still tend to be a little cautious about making three-point shots, possibly because three-point shots are riskier shots. Likewise, two-point shots were generally concentrated around the hoop, while three-point shots were generally concentrated around the three-point line. This indicates that the players shoot two-point shots as close to the hoop as possible and three-point shots as close to the boundary between a two-point shot and a three-point shot as possible, which in turn implies that the players believe that both shot types are more effective when made as close to the hoop as possible.

There were a few intriguing observations regarding the relative placements of the players in each table that reflected the drastically different efficacies between two-point and three-point shots. Curry was the fourth-most effective shooter overall despite the fact that he was third-most effective for two-point shots and second-most effective for three-point shots. Durant was the most-effective overall shooter even though he was only second-most effective for two-point shots and third-most effective for three-point shots. The most effective two-point shooter, Iguodala, was the second most effective overall shooter, while the most effective three-point shooter, Thompson, was the third-most effective shooter. As two-point shots are more likely to succeed than three-point shots, this data shows that the efficacy of a player's two-point shots contribute significantly more to his overall shot efficacy than three-point shots, even if a player is relatively more efficient with three-point shots than two-point shots.

Conclusion
----------

The relative efficacy of each the players shots depends on the type of shot attempted as well as is location, which impacts the players' shooting choices. Two-point shots are significantly more effective than three-point shots, and shots are generally more successful when there are attempted closer to the hoop. As a result, to maximize the chances of success, players tend to attempt more two-point shots than three-point shots, and these shots are attempted as close to the hoop as possible. Likewise, two-point shots contribute more to the overall shooting efficacy of a player (relative to his fellow players) than three-point shots because two-point shots have a higher chance of success. Thus, the strength of the Warriors' shooting comes from their skill and their strategy when shooting.
